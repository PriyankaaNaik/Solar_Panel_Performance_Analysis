# Solar Panel Performance Analysis
Solar panels are a great invention but fail to give 100% of efficiency many times due to various reasons. As a solution to one of such problems, this project is developed to find the factors that are affecting the performance of solar panels on the basis of their atmospheric conditions and locations. The dataset used in this project consists of 12 different locations in the northern hemisphere. This project is executed in Google Colab and can be executed on Jupiter notebook as well. After getting the results, they are visualized in Tableau to understand and study them in a much better and easier way.
